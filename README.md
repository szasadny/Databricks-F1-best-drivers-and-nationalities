This is a Databricks project I made to test my understanding before undergoing the Databricks Data Engineer Associate exam. This notebook ingests data from the ergast.com API of all the Formula 1 driver standings by year, then transforms it into one big table with the sum of the points of each driver. Finally it shows the top 10 drivers of all time(by points) and the top 10 nationalities of all time(by points).
